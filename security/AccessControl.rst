Access Control
==============

Overview
--------

A goal is to support authentication and authorization seamlessly
between the Kylo applications and the Hadoop cluster.

Authorization
-------------

Authorization within Kylo will use access control lists (ACL) to control
what actions users may perform and what data they may see. Â The actions
that a user or group may perform, whether to invoke a function or access
data, are organized into a hierarchy, and privileges may be granted at
any level in that hierarchy.

Authorization in Kylo is divided into two layers: service-level (Kylo-wide) permissions and entity-level permissions.
A permission in Kylo is the granting to a user or group the right to perform some action, such as see the description of a template, 
create and edit a category, enable/disable a feed, etc.  Access to these functions can often be controlled at both 
the service-level and entity-level.

Users and Groups can be updated using the Users and Groups pages under the Admin section in Kylo.

.. note:: If groups are enabled for an authentication plugin module, then user groups will be provided by the external provider and may not be updatable from the Users page.

Default Users and Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Kylo is newly installed, it will be pre-configured with  a few default users
and groups defined; with varying permissions assigned to each group.  The default groups are:

   * Administrators
   * Operations
   * Designers
   * Analysts
   * Users

The default users and their assigned groups are:

   * Data Lake Administrator - Administrators, Users
   * Analyst - Analysts, Users
   * Designer - Designers, Users
   * Operator - Operations, Users

The initial installation will also
have the `auth-kylo` and `auth-file` included in the active profiles configured in
the conf/application.properties file of both the UI and Services.  With these profiles
active the authentication process will use both the built-in Kylo user store and a username/password
file to authenticate requests.  In this configuration, all activated login modules
will have to successfully authenticate a request before access will be granted.

Service-Level Authorization
---------------------------

Service-level access controla what functions are permitted kylo-wide.  Access is controlled
by granting permissions to groups to perform a set of actions.  A logged in user would
then be authorized to perform any actions permitted to the groups to which the user is a member.

At the service-level, the heirarchical actions available for granting
to groups are organized as follows:

   - **Access Kylo Metadata** - Allows the ability to view and query directly the data in the Kylo metadata store, including extensible types

      - **Administer Kylo Metadata** - Allows the ability to directly manage the data in the Kylo metadata store (edit raw metadata, create/update/delete extensible types, update feed status events)

   - **Access Feed Support** - Allows access to feeds and feed-related functions

      - **Access Feeds** - Allows access to feeds and their metadata

         - **Edit Feeds** - Allows creating, updating, enabling and disabling feeds

         - **Import Feeds** - Allows importing of previously exported feeds (.zip files)

         - **Export Feeds** - Allows exporting feeds definitions (.zip files)

         - **Administer Feeds** - Allows deleting feeds and editing feed metadata

      - **Access Tables** - Allows listing and querying Hive tables

      - **Access Visual Query** - Allows access to visual query data wrangler

      - **Access Categories** - Allows access to categories and their metadata

         - **Edit Categories** - Allows creating, updating and deleting categories

         - **Administer Categories** - Allows updating category metadata

      - **Access Templates** - Allows access to feed templates

         - **Edit Templates** - Allows creating, updating, deleting and sequencing feed templates

         - **Import Templates** - Allows importing of previously exported templates (.xml and .zip files)

         - **Export Templates** - Allows exporting template definitions (.zip files)

         - **Administer Templates** - Allows enabling and disabling feed templates

      - **Access Data Sources** - Allows (a) access to data sources (b) viewing tables and schemas from a data source (c) using a data source in transformation feed

         - **Edit Data Sources** - Allows creating and editing data sources

         - **Administer Data Sources** - Allows getting data source details with sensitive info

      - **Access Service Level Agreements** - Allows access to service level agreements

         - **Edit Service Level Agreements** - Allows creating and editing service level agreements

      - **Access Global Search** - Allows access to search all indexed columns

   - **Access Users and Groups Support** - Allows access to user and group-related functions

      - **Access Users** - Allows the ability to view existing users

         - **Administer Users** - Allows the ability to create, edit and delete users

      - **Access Groups** - Allows the ability to view existing groups

         - **Administer Groups** - Allows the ability to create, edit and delete groups

   - **Access Operational Information** - Allows access to operational information like active feeds, execution history, job and feed stats, health status, etc.

       - **Administer Operations** - Allows administration of operations, such as creating/updating alerts, restart/stop/abandon/fail jobs, start/pause scheduler, etc.

   - **Access Encryption Services** - Allows the ability to encrypt and decrypt values

The above actions are hierarchical, in that being permitted a lower level action (such as Edit Feeds) implies being granted the higher-level actions (Access Feeds & Access Feed Support).

.. note:: Although permissions to perform the above actions are currently granted to groups, a future Kylo version may switch to a role-based mechanism similar to the entity-level access control (see below.)

Entity-Level Authorization
--------------------------

Entity-level authorization is an additional, optional form of access control that applies to individual entities: templates, feeds, categories, etc.  Entity-level access control is similar to service-level 
in that it involves granting permissions to perform a hierarchical set of actions.  These actions, though, would apply only to an individual entity.  

Entity-level access control is turned off by default.  To activate this feature you must set this property to true in ``kylo-services/conf/application.properties`` and then restart Kylo:

.. code-block:: properties

   security.entity.access.controlled=true

..

.. warning:: Turning on entity-level access control is a one-way operation; you cannot reset the above property back to false to deactivate this feature

Roles
~~~~~

Entity-level access control differs from service-level access control in that permissions are not granted to individual groups, rather they are granted to one or more **roles**.  
A role is a named, pre-configured set of granted permissions that may be applied to a group or individual user for a particular entity instance.
Roles are defined and associated with each kind of entity and may be granted permission to perform any of the actions defined for that entity type.  
The actual members (users or groups) of a role are associated at the entity-level, though, and grant permissions to perform actions on that entity only.

For instance, there might be the roles *Editor*, *Admin*, and *Read-Only* defined that grant varying sets of permissions for feeds.  
Adding a user, or any group that user belongs to, as a member of the *Editors* role of a specific feed will permit that user to make changes to it.  
A particular user might be a member of the *Editor* role for one feed, an *Admin* member of another feed, but only a *Read-Only* member of a third feed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kylo comes with a set of default roles for each kind of entity as described below.

.. note:: As of Kylo verion 0.8.1, entity roles and their granted permissions are fixed.  Future versions of Kylo will allow for creation and management of custom roles and assigned permissions.

Why Two Levels of Access Control?
---------------------------------

Kylo support two levels acces control because not all installations require the fine-grained control of entity-level authorization.
Service-level authorization is generally easier to manage if your security requirements are not very selective or stringent.  If 
you only need the ability to restrict some Kylo actions to certain select groups of users then service-level might be sufficient.

If your installation deals with sensitive information, and you need to be very selective of what data certain users and groups can see and 
manipulate, then you should use entity-level authorization to provide tight controls over that data.

Having two security schemes can pose management challenges as there is a bit of an overlap between the service-level and entity-level
permissions, and both levels of access control must be satisfied for a user's action to be successful.  If you choose to use entity-level
control then it may be helpful to loosen up the service-level access a bit more where the entity and service permissions are redundant.  To help
determine what permissions are needed to perform common Kylo activities, the next section describes both kinds of access requirements
depending upon what actions are attempted in Kylo.

Roles and Permissions Required for Common Activities
----------------------------------------------------

To help understand and manage permissions required by users when using Kylo, the following tables show:

   #. Common actions in Kylo
   #. The default entity-level roles that permit those actions
   #. Additional service-level permissions reqired to perform those actions
