Upgrade Instructions from v0.8.2
--------------------------------

Build or `download the RPM <http://bit.ly/2uT8bTo>`__

1. Uninstall Kylo:

 .. code-block:: shell

   /opt/kylo/remove-kylo.sh

 ..

2. Install the new RPM:

 .. code-block:: shell

     rpm â€“ivh <RPM_FILE>

 ..

3. Update the NiFi nars.  Run the following shell script to copy over the new NiFi nars/jars to get new changes to NiFi processors and services.

   .. code-block:: shell

      /opt/kylo/setup/nifi/update-nars-jars.sh <NIFI_HOME> <KYLO_SETUP_FOLDER> <NIFI_LINUX_USER> <NIFI_LINUX_GROUP>

      Example:  /opt/kylo/setup/nifi/update-nars-jars.sh /opt/nifi /opt/kylo/setup nifi users
   ..

4. Backup the Kylo database.  Run the following code against your kylo database to export the 'kylo' schema to a file.  Replace the  PASSWORD with the correct login to your kylo database.

  .. code-block:: shell

     mysqldump -u root -pPASSWORD --databases kylo >kylo-0_8_2_backup.sql

  ..

5. Database updates.  Kylo uses liquibase to perform database updates.  Two modes are supported.

 - Automatic updates

     By default Kylo is set up to automatically upgrade its database on Kylo services startup. As such,
     there isn't anything specific an end user has to do. When Kylo services startup the kylo database will be automatically upgraded to latest version if required.
     This is configured via an application.properties setting

     .. code-block:: properties

         liquibase.enabled=true
     ..

 - Manual updates

     Sometimes, however you may choose to disable liquibase and manually apply the upgrade scripts.  By disabling liquibase you are in control of how the scripts are applied.  This is needed if the kylo database user doesnt have priviledges to make schema changes to the kylo database.
     Please follow this :doc:`../how-to-guides/DatabaseUpgrades` on how to manually apply the additional database updates.

6. Update NiFi to use default ActiveMQ JMS provider. Kylo now supports two JMS providers out-of-the-box: ActiveMQ and Amazon SQS. A particular provider is selected by active Spring profile in ``/opt/nifi/ext-config/config.properties``.

   6.1. Edit ``/opt/nifi/ext-config/config.properties``

   6.2. Add following line to enable ActiveMQ ``spring.profiles.active=jms-activemq``

   Please follow this :doc:`../how-to-guides/JmsProviders` on how to switch active JMS Provider.
