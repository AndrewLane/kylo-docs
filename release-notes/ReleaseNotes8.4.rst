Upgrade Instructions from v0.8.3
--------------------------------
- **Order of execution of instructions to be updated**

1. Stop NiFi:

 .. code-block:: shell

   service nifi stop

 ..

2. Uninstall Kylo:

 .. code-block:: shell

   /opt/kylo/remove-kylo.sh

 ..

3. Install the new RPM:

 .. code-block:: shell

     rpm â€“ivh <RPM_FILE>

 ..


4. Global search configuration (only applicable if using Elasticsearch):

    4.1. This step to create kylo indexes may already have been performed as part of v0.8.3 installation. If indexes already exist, Elasticsearch will report an ``index_already_exists_exception``. It is safe to ignore this and continue.

    Change the host and port if necessary. The last two parameters define *num-shards* and *num-replicas*, and can be kept as 1 for development environment.

    .. code-block:: shell

        /opt/kylo/bin/create-kylo-indexes-es.sh localhost 9200 1 1
    ..

    4.2. If using Elasticsearch v5, update the **Index Text Service** feed. This step should be done once Kylo services are started and Kylo is up and running. [Note: This requires NiFi 1.3 or later]

    Import the feed ``index_text_service_v2.feed.zip`` file available at ``/opt/kylo/setup/data/feeds/nifi-1.3``. Click 'Yes' for these options during feed import (a) Overwrite Feed (b) Replace Feed Template (c) Replace Reusable Template.

    4.3. If using Elasticsearch v2, install an additional plugin to support deletes. If required, change the location to where Elasticsearch is installed.

    .. code-block:: shell

         sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin install delete-by-query
         service elasticsearch restart

    ..


5. JMS configuration:

It was previously possible to provide ActiveMQ and AmazonSQS configuration in their respective configuration files called ``activemq.properties`` and ``amazon-sqs.properties``.
It is no longer possible and these properties should be moved over to standard Kylo configuration file found in ``<KYLO_HOME>/kylo-services/conf/application.properties``.

6. Kylo no longer ships with the default **dladmin** user. You will need to re-add this user only if you're using the default authentication configuration:

   - Uncomment the following line in :code:`/opt/kylo/kylo-services/conf/application.properties` and :code:`/opt/kylo/kylo-ui/conf/application.properties` :

.. code-block:: properties

    security.auth.file.users=file:///opt/kylo/users.properties
    security.auth.file.groups=file:///opt/kylo/groups.properties

..

   - Create a file called :code:`users.properties` file that is owned by kylo and replace **dladmin** with a new username and **thinkbig** with a new password:

.. code-block:: shell

    echo "dladmin=thinkbig" > /opt/kylo/users.properties
    chown kylo:users /opt/kylo/users.properties
    chmod 600 /opt/kylo/users.properties

   - Create a file called :code:`groups.properties` file that is owned by kylo and set the default groups:

.. code-block:: shell

    vi /opt/kylo/users.properties

.. code-block:: properties

    dladmin=admin,user
    analyst=analyst,user
    designer=designer,user
    operator=operations,user

.. code-block:: shell

    chown kylo:users /opt/kylo/groups.properties
    chmod 600 /opt/kylo/groups.properties

7. Update the NiFi nars.  Run the following shell script to copy over the new NiFi nars/jars to get new changes to NiFi processors and services.

   .. code-block:: shell

      /opt/kylo/setup/nifi/update-nars-jars.sh <NIFI_HOME> <KYLO_SETUP_FOLDER> <NIFI_LINUX_USER> <NIFI_LINUX_GROUP>

      Example:  /opt/kylo/setup/nifi/update-nars-jars.sh /opt/nifi /opt/kylo/setup nifi users

8. Start NiFi and Kylo

 .. code-block:: shell

   service nifi start

   /opt/kylo/start-kylo-apps.sh

 ..

    8.1 Once Kylo is up and running, refer back to step 4.2 to update the **Index Text Service** feed if using Elasticsearch v5.
