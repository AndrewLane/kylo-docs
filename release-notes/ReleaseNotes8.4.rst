Upgrade Instructions from v0.8.3
--------------------------------
- **Order of execution of instructions to be updated**

1. Stop NiFi:

 .. code-block:: shell

   service nifi stop

 ..

2. Uninstall Kylo:

 .. code-block:: shell

   /opt/kylo/remove-kylo.sh

 ..

3. Install the new RPM:

 .. code-block:: shell

     rpm â€“ivh <RPM_FILE>

 ..

- If using Elasticsearch 5, update the **Index Text Service** feed. This step should be done once Kylo services are started and Kylo is up and running.

    - [Note: This requires NiFi 1.3 or later] Import the feed ``index_text_service_v2.feed.zip`` file available at ``/opt/kylo/setup/data/feeds/nifi-1.3``. Click 'Yes' for these options during feed import (a) Overwrite Feed (b) Replace Feed Template (c) Replace Reusable Template.

- If using Elasticsearch 2, install an additional plugin to support deletes. If required, change the location to where Elasticsearch is installed.

.. code-block:: shell

     sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin install delete-by-query
     service elasticsearch restart

..


4. JMS configuration:

It was previously possible to provide ActiveMQ and AmazonSQS configuration in their respective configuration files called ``activemq.properties`` and ``amazon-sqs.properties``.
It is no longer possible and these properties should be moved over to standard Kylo configuration file found in ``<KYLO_HOME>/kylo-services/conf/application.properties``.

5. Kylo no longer ships with the default **dladmin** user. You will need to re-add this user only if you're using the default authentication configuration:

   - Uncomment the following line in :code:`/opt/kylo/kylo-services/conf/application.properties`:

.. code-block:: properties

    security.auth.file.users=file:///opt/kylo/users.properties

..

   - Create a file at :code:`users.properties` file that is owned by kylo and replace **dladmin** with a new username and **thinkbig** with a new password:

.. code-block:: shell

    echo "dladmin=thinkbig" > /opt/kylo/users.properties
    chown kylo:kylo /opt/kylo/users.properties
    chmod 600 /opt/kylo/users.properties

6. Update the NiFi nars.  Run the following shell script to copy over the new NiFi nars/jars to get new changes to NiFi processors and services.

   .. code-block:: shell

      /opt/kylo/setup/nifi/update-nars-jars.sh <NIFI_HOME> <KYLO_SETUP_FOLDER> <NIFI_LINUX_USER> <NIFI_LINUX_GROUP>

      Example:  /opt/kylo/setup/nifi/update-nars-jars.sh /opt/nifi /opt/kylo/setup nifi users

7. Start NiFi and Kylo

 .. code-block:: shell

   service nifi start

   /opt/kylo/start-kylo-apps.sh

 ..
